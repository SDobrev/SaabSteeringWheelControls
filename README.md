Simple Arduino project to connect Saab Steering wheel controls to Pioneer HU.
Digital 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 pins are triggering transistors used as switchs to a resistor block.

Corelation between pressed button and output voltage from the steering wheel wires

Pioneer wired remote:
1,2K = source/2 sec. off
3,3k = ATT (mute)
8,2K = tune up/next track
12K = tune down/previous track
15K = volume up +
22K = volume down -
